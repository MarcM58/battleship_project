## Project Description
We decided to code a Battleship game simulator using Python for our first project of the bootcamp. Let's see the result ;)

## Rules
Both sides (Player versus Computer) is assigned a float containing 6 boats, on a board of 10 rows and 10 columns. 
The winner is the first who sinks all the ennemy's float. 
Each turn, one calls a letter between A and J, and a digit between 0 and 9. This exact place is fired on the ennemy board.

## Workflow
We worked through GitHub as much as possible. Not so easy. So mostly on Slack.
We used Sublime Text, Spyder, Jupyter Notebook to write code.

## Organization
Tasks were first planned on a trello.
Then we worked apart and merge our ideas on zoom meetings or slack.

Our repository is simply made of the python file of the battleship gameplay code, and the traditional README file.
